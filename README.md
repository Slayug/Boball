<p>I made this little game for http://2015.js13kgames.com/</p>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>
Hi,<br>
Just use the mouse to play.<br>
Left click: place one white ball<br>
Right click: reverse the other ball<br>

The goal is to collide your white ball with the other who are in move..<br>
After some level, it's the line between your two balls who should be in collision..<br><br>

Have Fun :)
